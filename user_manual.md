1.0 INTRODUCTION

This is an easy to use web forum enabling users to write and reply to posts. This user guide will explain the general uses of the website as well as the intended users and purpose.

1.1 SCOPE AND PURPOSE

This website is intended for current and potential University of Maryland iSchool students to have a way to gain knowledge on the programs offered through the iSchool and any other information needs associated with these programs. The iSchool, specifically Information Science, is a fairly new program at the University of Maryland and therefore there hasn’t previously been a succinct place for questions to be asked and answered. At a minimum users should be able to access the forum created and be able to post new threads and replies to other users.



2.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Our system allows for users to ask and answer questions easily in relation to the UMD iSchool. Through this system users will be first taken to our homepage which contains capabilities including: accessing previous user posts, writing new posts, and navigating to iSchool main pages. Users can also navigate to specific topic pages by clicking on a post in the discussion board that interests them. These individual post pages enable users to view posts, reply to posts, and see the previous replies that users have left.



3.0 GENERAL NAVIGATION

This website has two page structures, our main page and the reply pages. The main page which is also the landing page for users consists of the discussion board, a list of the different posts that users have already created, and a place to actually write new posts. The reply pages can be accessed by clicking on a specific post of interest in the discussion board. These reply pages show the content of the original post selected, other replies that users have made, as well as a space for users to write their own replies.

3.1 CREATING A POST

For the user to create a post they simply need to scroll down to the bottom of our main page below the discussion board. Users will be asked to include their university status, email address, post title, and then their actual post. Below is a submit button titled “Add Topic”, once clicked the post is added to the discussion board and other users can reply to it.

3.2 REPLYING TO A POST

In order to reply to a post a user can select a specific post from the discussion board list. Once they click on the post they are interested in the site will navigate them to the reply page. On this page is the original post that the user wants to reply to as well as a space for replies. The user can then type their reply in this space. We simply ask that the person replying includes their university status at the bottom of the post. Once complete, below the reply space is a submit button for the reply to show up on the post’s page.

3.3 NAVIGATION BUTTONS

At the top of the website pages, there are three navigation buttons. If the user clicks on these buttons they will be taken to other iSchool pages. Through our site users can be redirected to the iSchool’s homepage, about page, and contact page respectively.
